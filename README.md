[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

This repository contains the results and technical aspects  of the Data Science Core IP "You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.

A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

You have two possible approaches (as  shown below) given the datasets that will be provided

Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)

### Approach 1: Polynomial approach

What to train given:

Rank of home team
Rank of away team
Tournament type

Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

### Approach 2: Logistic approach

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)

## Overview

This repository contains the technical aspects of Data Science Core IP submission week 6 as outlined above. The project applies the regression techniques learnt as well as feature engineering, cross validation, heteroskedasticity test and hyperparameter tuning.
